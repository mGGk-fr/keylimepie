# Use KeyLimePie from JS file
This guide will show you how to use KeyLimePie using the `js` and `css` distributed files.

## Getting files
Please head to [GitHub release page](https://github.com/mGGk-fr/keylimepie) and download latest release.

## Load file in your template
Edit your `<head>` section of your template to add following code:
```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='/keylimepie.css'>
<script type="text/javascript" defer src='/keylimepie.js' />
```

::: tip
Please edit href according to your structure.
:::

## Hook script loaded event
To do clean stuff, we will hook js loading event to a function that will instantiate KeyLimePie.
To do this, edit the `script` tag added below to add an `onload` hook.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" defer src='/keylimepie.js' onload="initCookieManager()"/>
```

## Instanciate KeyLimePie
Now that all files are loaded correctly, we need to configure and run KeyLimePie.
To do this, we will use the `onload` hook previously added. In the hook we call a function called `initCookieManager`.
You must implement this function in your page.
To do so, you must add a `script` tag at the end of your body containing the invocation code.

```js
<script>
    function initCookieManager() {
        var cookieManager = new KeyLimePie();
        cookieManager.initialise();
    }
</script>
```

## Configure KeyLimePie
Configuring KeyLimePie is simple as hell !

Each config must be done between the KeyLimePie instantiation `new KeyLimePie` and the initialisation `cookieManager.initilise`.

### Add Service
To add a service, please refere to the [Service](/services/) page that refer all implemented services.
Each service has it's own implementation, but don't be afraid, each service is quite simple to implement.
For each service, you must add implementation code in your init function.
Here's an example implementing [Hotjar](/services/hotjar/) :

```js
<script>
    function initCookieManager() {
        var cookieManager = new KeyLimePie();
        cookieManager.addService("googletagmanager", {gtmId: '123456'});
        cookieManager.addService("hotjar", {hotjarId: 1234567, HotjarSv: 8})
        cookieManager.initialise();
    }
</script>
```

### Setting language
Currently supported languages are `fr` and `en`.
Setting language is also very easy ! You just have to set language using following code :
```js
<script>
    function initCookieManager() {
        var cookieManager = new KeyLimePie();
        cookieManager.setLang("fr");
        cookieManager.addService("googletagmanager", {gtmId: '123456'});
        cookieManager.addService("hotjar", {hotjarId: 1234567, HotjarSv: 8})
        cookieManager.initialise();
    }
</script>
```
